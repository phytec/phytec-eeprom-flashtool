Product Overview Table
======================

This table maps our products to the used EEPROMs for hardware introspection, the I2C addresses and the API revision used.

For our SoMs, we have a set of common base boards and extension boards. To be able to use these products interchangeable, we need to set a global address space.

Secondly, as we will fixate the API revision as soon as a product is release for mass market, we need to log the revision.
