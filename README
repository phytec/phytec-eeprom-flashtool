PHYTEC EEPROM Flashtool

----------------

This tool is intended for reading from and writing to PHYTEC SOM EEPROM chips.

Use of this tool requires a properly-formatted configuration file for each
target PHYTEC platform (PCM-057.ini for PCM-057 boards, for example).
By default, this tool looks for configuration files in a 'configs' subdirectory
to where the script is currently located.

Usage:

	phytec_eeprom_flashtool.py [(-d|--dir) DIR] <command>

	-d or --dir <DIR> overrides the config directory (relative or absolute)

Commands:

	read <SOM>

	Description:
	Read command reads the EEPROM and prints the EEPROM contents and kit
	options described by the <SOM>.ini file.

	display <BOM> <PCB revision>

	Description:
	Display command parses the kit options, BOM revision, and PCB revision
	and prints the resulting EEPROM contents without writing to the EEPROM.
	This command is intended as a "dry run" for the write command.

	write <BOM> <PCB revision>

	Description:
	Write command parses the kit options, BOM revision, and PCB revision
	and writes them to the EEPROM.

Examples:

	phytec_eeprom_flashtool.py read PCM-057

	phytec_eeprom_flashtool.py display PCM-057-40201111I.A0 3

	phytec_eeprom_flashtool.py write PCM-057-KSP01.A2 4
